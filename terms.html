        <p><strong>Waiver</strong></p>
        <p>
            Failure to exercise any right or require performance under these Terms does not affect the ability to exercise

        </p>
        <p><strong>Translation Interpretation</strong></p>
        <p>
            If these Terms are provided in multiple languages, the English version shall prevail in the event of any
